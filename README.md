# Development

### Link to Deployed Website
If you used the stencil code, this is `https://<your GitHub username>.github.io/<name of your repository>`

### Goal and Value of the Application
The goal of my application is a shopping site for shoes where users can filter and sort the shoes they want to buy. 
### Usability Principles Considered

### Organization of Components
I used some of bootstraps components and create a shoe component which is what was displayed.
### How Data is Passed Down Through Components

The data is passed down through components using props.

### How the User Triggers State Changes

The user triggers state changes when they add/remove items to the cart and selects any of the radio buttons
